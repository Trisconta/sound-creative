# Can-Utility and the Coastliners - Bullet-Point Cheat Sheet

## Core Idea
- Retells the legend of King Canute (Cnut), an 11th-century ruler
- Canute demonstrates that even a king cannot command the sea
- The story becomes a metaphor for the limits of power and human pride

---

## Title Meaning
- "Can-Utility": a playful nickname for King Canute
- "Coastliners": the waves and forces of nature
- Title suggests a clash between human authority and natural inevitability

---

## Main Themes
- Limits of power
- Humility and wisdom
- Futility of resisting nature or time
- Change and impermanence
- Reflection and calm acceptance

---

## Story Elements
- Canute's followers believe he has absolute power
- He orders the sea to stop rising to prove them wrong
- The sea ignores him, showing nature's dominance
- The lesson: rulers are human, not divine

---

## Musical Notes
- Gentle acoustic opening with mellotron textures
- Builds into a dramatic instrumental middle section
- Shifts in rhythm and intensity mirror the rising sea
- Returns to a calm ending, echoing acceptance and humility
- Strong compositional influence from Steve Hackett

---

## Why It Stands Out on Foxtrot
- Shortest narrative-style track on the album
- Combines myth, philosophy, and emotional depth
- Acts as a reflective moment between heavier pieces
- Shows Genesis's ability to tell a full story in under six minutes
